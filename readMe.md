#Project 4: Stand Up Soirée

<hr>

###Overview
Stand Up Soirée allows users to plan a night out based around watching stand-up comedy. 


###Project Brief

##### Technical Requirements


* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design**
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end, and _at least_ one classical and one functional component on the front-end. 

##### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working app** hosted on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file**

###Trello

I used Trello to much better effect on this project than in my previous ones. I was much better able to keep across what needed to be done and not get blocked.

###Challenges and Problems

It was challenging at first to figure out the step-by-step process of building the app and inputting this into my Trello board.

If a user registered as a charity, I found it difficult to display (on the charity show page) nearby vendors offering food within a 3000m radius of the charity's location. It required a change in the donations controller.

The functionality behind a logged in charity user being able to click on a vendor icon and route to their show page was also more difficult than I originally expected.

###Wins

At the beginning of each day I would plan out my goals and try to hit my targets for the day. This way, I was able to keep to a strict schedule and meet MVP after 4 days of working.

I am proud of all the functionality I have produced in the project as well as the styling.

---

###Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

Include a comments section/messaging platform so vendors and charities can communicate over the application.

Link the app to city mapper so that users can get a route from their current location to the event.
